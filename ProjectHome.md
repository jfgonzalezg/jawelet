## About ##

This project is dedicated to my graduate work about compression of images with using discrete wavelet transfom(DWT).

Here you can find some code related to Discrete Wavelet Transform, Cyclic Extension, Haar wavelet filters, LeGall 5/3 filters, some other filters in future and so on.

@See also http://code.google.com/p/jwave/ for more Wavelets and other transforms implementations
